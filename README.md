# Dibimbing DSDA Project


Hi! My name is Rizky Febri Ibra Habibie, Habibie to be called.
I live in Taiwan, working as a Management Trainee in a fireproof door manufacturing company.

I have always been a person who acknowledges the need for some process that requires optimization, whether through traditional or modern methods.
But we all live in a modern way, which also becomes one of my concerns to be able to optimize using Python, one of the methods is scaling up the skills of my Data Science and Data Analytics.
This is a witness repository of my learning journey on Data Science and Data Analytics.
